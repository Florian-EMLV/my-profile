        <p>
          Welcome to my page, I'm 18 and I'm a Student at EMLV - École de Management Léonard de Vinci.

        <h2>Movie</h2>
          <p>
            I watch a lot of movies to entertain myself but also to enrich my culture. Recently I went to the cinema to see the latest James Bond film as well as The Eternals and Shang-Chi. I really like films about money like The Wolf of Wall Street or The Big Short for example.

        <h2>Music</h2>
          <p>
            I also listen to a lot of music, especially during my long commute to class. I like to vary the style of music so I don't get bored. I mainly listen to French rap and American rap but also to classical music, French variety, pop; I am really curious.

        <h2>Sport</h2>
          <p>
            I did a lot of sport when I was younger, I had a more than decent competitive level. But now I try to keep fit by going to the gym several times a week, even if the class schedule makes it difficult. But I love everything about the gym, including anatomy, muscles, nutrition, sleep and personal development.

        <h2>Video Games</h2>
          <p>
            Video games are also a big part of my life. I like the competitive aspect of some games like Rocket League where I have a very good competitive level. I'm part of the competitive team at LDV Esport association for Rocket League and many tournaments are coming up soon, hoping to win them.

        <h2>Anime</h2>
          <p>
            Anime is an excellent alternative to film. They offer totally different content, so you never get bored. Just like movies, I watch a lot of animes to entertain myself but also to enrich my culture.
